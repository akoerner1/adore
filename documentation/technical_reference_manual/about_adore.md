# Automated Driving Open Research (ADORe)

## About ADORe

Eclipse ADORe is a modular software library and toolkit for decision making, 
planning, control and simulation of automated vehicles. 
 It developed by [The German Aerospace Center (DLR), 
 Institute for Transportation Systems ðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/ts/en).
ADORe provides some of the following features and capabilities:

 - Algorithms and data models applied in real automated driving system for motion
  planning and control
 - Mechanisms for safe interaction with other CAVs, infrastructure, traffic 
  management, interactions with human-driven vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians
 - Integration with typical tools and formats such as [SUMO ðŸ”—](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo),
  CARLA, OpenDrive, Road2Simulation, ITS-G5 V2X (MAPEM, SPATEM, DENM, MCM, SREM)
 - ADORe is [ROS ðŸ”—](https://ros.org) based
 - ADORe is fully containerized using [Docker ðŸ”—](https://docker.io)
 - ADORe is currently deployed on DLR TS institute research vehicles [FASCar ðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/research-infrastructure/fascar-en) and [VIEWCar IIðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/research-infrastructure/view-car)
