## Getting Started

## Getting started with ADORe

    ```

4. Initialize and update the submodules:

    ```bash
    cd adore
    git submodule update --init
    ```

    > **⚠️ WARNING:**
    > Failing to update the submodules will result in build failures!

5. Build ADORe and ADORe CLI

> **ℹ️ INFO:**

> ethernet and **not** WIFI until initial docker and APT caches are established
> on your system.

After cloning ADORe and satisfying all system prerequisites you can build/run
the ADORe CLI context. To do this navigate to the root of the ADORe directory
and run the following command:
```bash
make cli
```
For more informant please visit the [ADORe CLI 🔗](../system_and_development/adore_cli.md) documentation.
